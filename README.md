I want to learn to use the content we learn in my Data Science module woth Python.

Here I am sharing my journey in using Python for a Data Science module I am taking in my final year of BSc Mathematics.

First one - SVD and PCA. Super simple but very important. 

I have uploaded the qs sheet, we have been given and I am not answering it but simply exploring how to code it.
